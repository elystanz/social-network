## <a id="introduction">Introduction</a>
This social network API is a great way to start your first social network. This API off the bat grants the ability to create users, posts, reactions, and make friends! Currently it must be controlled via a testing/debugging app such as Insomnia, but can be implemented as a back-end API in your front-end network!

## <a id="roadmap">Roadmap</a>
As development continues, this API will give a better foundation for social media platform creators to implement and begin their platform as quickly and efficiently as possible. Currently, the user and thought models are a great start. It would be great to add in moderator options for something like a forum site. This is something that is in development.
